# Uploading Files
The process of creating a server application that can receive HTTP multi-part file uploads

## What this creates
This will create a Spring Boot web application that accepts file uploads as well as a simple HTML interface to upload a test file

## Step 1: Create an Application Class
* To start a Spring Boot MVC application, you first need a starter. In this example, ```spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf``` and ```spring-boot-starter-web``` are already added as dependencies.
* To upload files with Servelet containers, you need to register a ```MultipartConfigElement``` class(which would be ```<multipart-config>``` in web.xml)
* Create the following ```UploadingFilesApplication``` class
    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class UploadingFilesApplication {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(UploadingFilesApplication.class, args);
        }
    }
    ```
* As part of auto-configuring Spring MVC, Spring Boot will create a ```MultipartConfigElement``` bean and make itself ready for file uploads

## Step 2: Create a File Upload Controller
* The initial application already contains a few classes to deal with storing and loading the uploaded files on disk.
* The files are located in the specific folder
* Create the ```FileUploadController``` class
    ```java
    
    ```
